This is a companion extension to the [Money extension](https://github.com/AntoineFr/flarum-ext-money) by AntoineFr.

This extension allows users to transfer money between each other by assigning rewards to posts.

The history of rewards given and received is shown on the user profile.

**Warning**: if you reward a post in a private discussion, anyone with access to the reward history will be able to access the post content and discussion title!

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-money-rewards

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
